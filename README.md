**Soundboard**

Soundboard is a database that stores all my favorite songs and upcoming concert dates for those artists.  I love music and seeing live acts.  This helps me manage that process in one place.  Also, my friends can see the type of music I like and tell me if they want to go to a show with me.

Let's get started.  Here's [Soundboard](https://song-collector.fly.dev/).

Here are my planning [materials](https://trello.com/b/hLlHtnd9/song-collector).
