**Soundboard**

Soundboard is a database that stores all my favorite songs and upcoming concert dates for those artists.  I love music and seeing live acts.  This helps me do that in one place.  Also, my friends can see the type of music I like and tell me if they want to go to a show with me.

Let's go the [Soundboard](https://song-collector.fly.dev/).
